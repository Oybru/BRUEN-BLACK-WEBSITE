Ideas:
*	In each subsection, add a "Work in Progress" section detailing things I'm currently working on.
* 	In the About Me section, add in a "Elevator Pitch" section and a "Long Version" section that's clickable from About Me section, currently writing those right now
*	 For the landing page, the top index menu gets washed out by the images, either make the images smaller so that the menu is below it, ORR make the index menu opaque (EASIER!!!)

- Updated the logo at the bottom to show double Bs
